# How-Many-Cups-

## Motivation
A website that I built to help me and my friends study.

###  Timer
I study with a technique called the pomodoro technique where you work hard for 25 minutes with no distractions and then rest for 5 minutes.

One of the functionalities of the website is (you guessed it) a 25 minute timer. Other pomodoro timers I worked with online did not allow the time on the dial to be customised if, for example, the page refreshed and the timer was accidentally reset. I made sure to add that functionality with a simple double click of the timer face.

### Cup Converter
As someone with an interest in Psychology, I like to look for ways to 'hack' my own brain. After researching things like dopamine levels, I found that by drawing a little cup of coffee on a page after every 25 minute stint, I would get a small dopamine hit. At the end of the day I would also have a visual representation of how much work I had done by counting the cups of coffee. 

The only problem was that converting the number of cups into hours and minutes was not as easy as it might have been had each cup represented 30 mins of work rather than 25. I therefore added a page to convert the number of cups drawn into hours and minutes.


### Todos
I was using lots of different applications which resulted in me having many tabs open, manking it difficult to navigate. I therfore decided to add a todos page to try and keep all my study related applications on one page. 

If you log in, the todos are saved until next time, but you can use it without logging in too, and the todos are saved for a few hours using sessions.
